%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
%
%     gaussianKernel.m
%     dataset3Params.m
%     processEmail.m
%     emailFeatures.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% =============== Part 6: Visualizing Dataset 3 ================
%  The following code will load the next dataset into your environment and 
%  plot the data. 
%

fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

% Plot training data
plotData(X, y);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% ========== Part 7: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 3) ==========

%  This is a different dataset that you can use to experiment with. Try
%  different values of C and sigma here.
% 

% Load from ex6data3: 
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('ex6data3.mat');

% Try different SVM Parameters here
[C, sigma] = dataset3Params(X, y, Xval, yval);

% Train the SVM
%model= svmTrain(X, y, C, @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma));
%visualizeBoundary(X, y, model);

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
