This is where I plan to put all my code (however little) related to the Stanford Online AI and ML classes.  Hoping that I can also put any octave code in here but we'll see.

UPDATE (15 Dec 2011)
Haven't been pushing my commits because I remembered the Honor Code (e.g. not sharing files).  Figured that posting my Octave exercises is probably not cool until the course ends.
